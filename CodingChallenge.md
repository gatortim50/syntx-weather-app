## Existing Code
If you already have a project on GitHub that was built purely by yourself (visible through commit history), you can skip this coding challenge and just share that repository with us. Either send us the public URL or invite us (Username: JPWallhorn).

## Requirements
The coding challenge consists of building a weather client for iOS or Android. Weâ€™d love for a candidate to spend roughly 4 hours on this challenge:

- User can see a list of cities with the current temperature and weather summary icon
- User can select a new city from a hardcoded set of cities and preferences are stored
- User can tap into a city and see the current weather, summary icon and a 7-day forecast
- Data should be consumed from the OpenWeatherMap API (https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?id=524901&appid=b1b15e88fa797225412429c1c50c122a1) and display relevant weather icons (https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)
- Device should scale to a wide-variety of mobile phone sizes, portrait mode only
- Automated tests should be includes
- A readme should be included with the following:
  - Description of app architecture
  - Description of any trade-offs made
  - Description of how to run within the device simulator
